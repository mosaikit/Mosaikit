# Installation

Mosaikit comes in four forms, all built from the same kernel and accepting the same plugin
packages. A build writes them to `target/dist` (see [building](../developer/development.md));
a release publishes them on the GitLab release page.

| Distribution | For | Needs | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portable archive | One organization, a PC or a small server, trials | nothing: Java and PostgreSQL are inside | [portable](../../distributions/portable/README.md) |
| Installation | A server with its own Java and PostgreSQL | Java 25, PostgreSQL 18 | [install](../../distributions/install/README.md) |
| Docker Compose | A server or a workstation with Docker; includes Keycloak | Docker or Podman | [docker](../../distributions/docker/README.md) |
| Kubernetes | Production, several organizations | Kubernetes, Helm 4, PostgreSQL, Keycloak | [k8s](../../distributions/k8s/README.md) |

## Portable or installation?

The portable archive (`mosaikit-portable-<version>-<platform>.zip` or `.tar.gz`) is complete:
unpack it and run `mosaikit` (Linux, macOS) or `mosaikit.cmd` (Windows). At the first start it
creates its PostgreSQL database in `data/`, generates its passwords, and writes the password of
the administrator to `data/initial-admin-password.txt`. Copying `data/` is a full backup.

The installation (`target/dist/mosaikit`) is the same layout without Java and PostgreSQL: set the
database and the administrator password in `config/application.properties` first.

## Layout of an installation

```
mosaikit, mosaikit.cmd   start scripts
README.md
config/                  application.properties, trusted-keys/ (keys of trusted plugin publishers)
plugins/                 plugin packages (*.zip), copied as they are
data/                    portable only: database and generated secrets
bin/                     kernel (with UI and launcher), java/ and pgsql/ (portable only)
```

## First start

1. Start Mosaikit and open <http://localhost:8080>.
2. Sign in as `admin` with the administrator password: the one set in
   `config/application.properties` (`mosaikit.bootstrap.admin-password`), in `.env` for Docker
   Compose, or in `data/initial-admin-password.txt` for the portable archive.
3. Change that password, then remove it from the configuration (or delete the file): it is used
   only when the database is empty.
4. Create the organizations ([administration](administration.md)) and install the plugins
   ([plugins](plugins.md)).

Behind a reverse proxy, serve Mosaikit over HTTPS only: in production the kernel sends
`Strict-Transport-Security`.
