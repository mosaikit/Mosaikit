# Mosaikit

Mosaikit is a domain-agnostic, plugin-based platform for building multi-organization web
applications. A small kernel provides what every product needs — identity, organizations,
users, localization, theming and plugin management — and everything else is a plugin.
Plugins can extend the user interface, the backend API and the database schema, and they
can in turn be extended by other plugins.

> Status: **early development** (0.1.0-SNAPSHOT). APIs and the plugin contract are not stable yet.

## Principles

- **Small kernel, everything else is a plugin.** The kernel knows nothing about any business
  domain.
- **One contract for everyone.** First-party plugins follow the same rules as third-party ones.
- **Plugins talk through the kernel.** Events, typed services and shared context, all declared
  in the plugin manifest.
- **Frontend-only plugins are active at once; Java plugins at the next start.** A plugin without
  Java code keeps its data in the kernel and works as soon as it is installed. Installing a Java
  plugin re-runs the Quarkus build step at the next start, the same model Keycloak uses for its
  providers.
- **Framework-agnostic frontend.** A plugin UI is a Web Component loaded as an ES module; it can
  be written with any framework.

## Repository layout

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `kernel/` | The kernel: one Quarkus application with the services, the launcher that loads Java plugins, and the web UI in `src/main/webui` (Lit + Vite). |
| `sdk/` | What third parties need to write plugins: `sdk/java` (the Java plugin API and the manifest schema), `sdk/js` (`@mosaikit/sdk` for plugin frontends) and `sdk/create-plugin` (a generator of new plugins). See [sdk/README.md](sdk/README.md). |
| `plugins/` | Sample plugins, which follow the same rules as third-party plugins: frontend only (`sample-hello`, `sample-todo`), written with a framework (`sample-react`, `sample-vue`), with Java code (`sample-notes`, `sample-activities`, `sample-estimates`). |
| `distributions/` | How Mosaikit is delivered: installation, portable archives, Docker, Kubernetes, Keycloak realm, release scripts. |
| `e2e/` | End-to-end tests with Playwright on a real installation. See [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md). |
| `tools/` | Scripts for development: `npm run dev` and the embedded PostgreSQL it starts. |
| `docs/` | Guides for users and developers, compliance (AgID, ACN, GDPR), decisions (ADR) and the requirements (`docs/requirements`, `MK-xxx`). See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). |

## Requirements

| Tool | Needed for |
|---|---|
| JDK 25 (LTS) | everything; Maven comes with the wrapper (`./mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd` on Windows) |
| Node.js 24 LTS or 26 | everything: the frontend, the development mode, the tests |
| Git | cloning the repository |
| Bash with `curl` and `tar` | only the portable archives (`-Pportable`). On Linux and macOS they are part of the system; on Windows install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), whose Git Bash the build uses from `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe` (another location: `-Dportable.bash=<path to bash.exe>`). The Bash of WSL is not used. |
| Docker or Podman | only the Docker distribution and the tests with Keycloak (`-Dtest.groups.excluded=`) |

PostgreSQL does not need to be installed: the development mode and the tests start PostgreSQL 18
from `node_modules` (package `embedded-postgres`), and the portable archives bring their own.

On Windows the commands below are the same with `mvnw.cmd` in place of `./mvnw`, in PowerShell
(`.\mvnw.cmd install ...`) or in the Command Prompt (`mvnw.cmd install ...`).

## Develop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosaikit/mosaikit.git
cd mosaikit
npm ci            # once, and after every change of package-lock.json
npm run dev       # kernel, shell, database and sample data; Ctrl+C stops everything
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and sign in:

| Who | Username | Password |
|---|---|---|
| platform administrator | `admin` | `admin-dev-only` |
| people of the organization `demo` | `mario.rossi@example.org`, `anna.bianchi@example.org` | `dev-password-2026` |

`npm run dev` builds the plugin API (a few seconds), starts PostgreSQL (its data in
`.dev/postgres`, kept between runs; `npm run dev -- --reset` starts again from an empty database)
and a fake language model for the assistant, then runs the kernel with `quarkus:dev`:

- Java code and the UI reload live (Quinoa runs Vite on `kernel/src/main/webui`).
- Plugins are read from `plugins/`, which is watched: save a file of a frontend, or add a plugin
  without Java code, and the open pages reload by themselves. Plugins with Java code are loaded
  only by the launcher of an installation (see [Try the distributions](#try-the-distributions)).
- Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui>. Dev UI: <http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui>.

To start a plugin of your own:

```bash
npm run build     # once: builds the SDK and the generator in sdk/create-plugin/dist
node sdk/create-plugin/dist/bin.js dev.example.signs --name Signs --directory plugins/signs
node sdk/create-plugin/dist/bin.js dev.example.roads --name Roads --backend --directory ../roads
```

The first one has no Java code: created in `plugins/`, it appears in the shell of `npm run dev`
at once. The second one, with Java code, is built with Maven and installed in a distribution. See
the [plugin development guide](docs/developer/plugin-development.md).

## Test

```bash
npm run check:fast                       # frontend: lint, type check, unit tests (seconds)
./mvnw verify -Dskip.npm -DskipITs       # backend: unit and Quarkus tests (minutes)
./mvnw install                           # everything, with the integration tests and the packages
npm run e2e                              # end-to-end tests, after ./mvnw install (or -DskipTests)
./mvnw spotless:apply && npm run format  # format the sources before a commit
```

No Docker is needed: every test starts its own PostgreSQL. `npm run e2e` builds a test
installation in `e2e/.work` from `target/dist`, starts it with its launcher and drives the shell
with Playwright. Pull requests run the same checks in CI; see
[docs/developer/development.md](docs/developer/development.md).

## Build the distributions

```bash
./mvnw install -DskipTests                # installation, Docker, Helm chart, sample plugins, catalog
./mvnw install -DskipTests -Pportable     # also the portable archives (Bash: see Requirements)
./mvnw install -DskipTests -Pportable -Dportable.platforms=windows-x64   # one platform only
./mvnw install -DskipTests -Pportable -rf :mosaikit-distributions         # only the distributions again
```

`-rf` (resume from) rebuilds only the last module and needs a previous full `install`. The
result is in `target/dist`:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `mosaikit/` | the installation for a server or a PC with Java 25 and PostgreSQL 18, with a signed catalog of the sample plugins in `catalog/` |
| `mosaikit-portable/` | the portable archives, `mosaikit-portable-<version>-<platform>.zip` or `.tar.gz`: Java and PostgreSQL included, nothing to install, for Windows, Linux and macOS (`-Pportable`) |
| `mosaikit-docker/` | Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Keycloak and Mosaikit |
| `mosaikit-k8s/` | the Helm chart |
| `plugins/` | the sample plugins, as packages to copy into `plugins/` |

Each one has a `README.md` with all the details.

## Try the distributions

**Portable archive**, the quickest, with nothing to install:

1. Unpack `target/dist/mosaikit-portable/mosaikit-portable-<version>-<platform>.zip` (`.tar.gz`
   on Linux and macOS) anywhere.
2. Start `mosaikit.cmd` (Windows, also with a double click) or `./mosaikit` (Linux, macOS).
3. Open <http://localhost:8080> and sign in as `admin` with the password in
   `data/initial-admin-password.txt`.

**Installation** (`target/dist/mosaikit`), with a PostgreSQL 18 of your own:

1. Create a database and a user, for example with Docker (port 55432, in case a PostgreSQL of the
   system already uses 5432):

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name mosaikit-pg -p 55432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=mosaikit \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mosaikit -e POSTGRES_DB=mosaikit postgres:18
   ```

2. Edit `config/application.properties`: `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`
   (`jdbc:postgresql://localhost:55432/mosaikit`), user, password, and
   `mosaikit.bootstrap.admin-password`, the password of the first administrator.
3. Start `./mosaikit` (Linux, macOS, Git Bash) or `mosaikit.cmd` (Windows), open
   <http://localhost:8080> and sign in as `admin`.

**Docker Compose**: in `target/dist/mosaikit-docker` change the passwords in `.env`, run
`docker compose up -d --build` and open <http://localhost:8080> (Keycloak on
<http://localhost:8180>).

**Kubernetes**: `target/dist/mosaikit-k8s` has the Helm chart and the commands to install it.

In every distribution plugins are installed in two ways:

- from the interface: the **Plugins** page of the administrator offers the signed catalog of the
  sample plugins, and accepts uploads of signed packages. Plugins without Java code are active at
  once; for the others the page asks to start Mosaikit again;
- by hand: copy a package (`target/dist/plugins/<name>.zip`) into `plugins/` of the installation
  and start Mosaikit again. Plugins with Java code are loaded by rebuilding the kernel at that
  start, which takes a few seconds.
