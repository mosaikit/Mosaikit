# End-to-end tests

Playwright tests on a real installation: the one that `./mvnw install` writes to `target/dist`,
started by its launcher on PostgreSQL, with the sample plugins installed from the signed catalog
through the Plugins page, and driven in Chromium. Only the language model of the assistant is a
fake (`support/fake-model.ts`), so that the tests check the kernel and the shell and not a model.

A requirement is done when its e2e cases pass, not only its unit tests: with 92% of the code
covered by unit tests, the first run of these cases found seven defects that only show up when
launcher, kernel, shell and browser work together.

## Run

```bash
./mvnw install -DskipTests            # target/dist, the generator and the plugin API in ~/.m2
docker run -d --name mosaikit-e2e-pg -p 55432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=mosaikit \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mosaikit -e POSTGRES_DB=mosaikit postgres:18
npx playwright install chromium        # once
npm run e2e                            # npm run e2e -- --headed, -- -g "22.4", -- --ui
```

The report is in `e2e/report/` (`npx playwright show-report e2e/report`); the test installation,
its log (`installation.log`) and the traces of failed tests in `e2e/.work/`. Use an empty database
for a run that starts from scratch.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_DB_URL`, `E2E_DB_USERNAME`, `E2E_DB_PASSWORD` | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:55432/mosaikit`, `mosaikit`, `mosaikit` | database of the test installation |
| `E2E_KERNEL_PORT` | `8181` | port of the test installation |
| `E2E_MODEL_PORT`, `E2E_CONTROL_PORT` | `18091`, `18090` | the fake model, and the endpoint with which tests restart the installation |

## How it works

- `global-setup.ts` copies `target/dist/mosaikit`, with its catalog `catalog/`, to
  `e2e/.work`, creates a signing key that the installation trusts and signs the catalog with it,
  starts the fake model and the installation, and creates the organization `comune-prova` with two
  people. Tests restart the installation (after installing Java plugins, or with other settings)
  through `restart()` of `support/shell.ts`.
- The files of `tests/` run in order in one worker: `01-marketplace` installs the sample plugins
  that the following files use.
- One test per case of the manual test plan, named after it (`22.4 …`), in a `describe` named after
  the requirement.
